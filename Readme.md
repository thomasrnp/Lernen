# Learning AI on the Jetson Nano

In this repo I follow along the **excellent lessons given by Paul McWhorter aka TopTechBoy.com on Youtube**. A few things to note:

- I have not yet bought the Jetson Nano
- Instead I follow on an Acer notebook, AMD Ryzen 5 3500U and Linux Mint 19.3
- Consequently I have no Raspi Cam attached and use the built-in webcam
- I installed openCV 3.3.1 but had to google it for Ubuntu, because the Jetson Nano way does not work for my setup
- I number my files openXX_some_tags.py, where XX is the number of the YouTube lessons. Paul started later in the course with number 1, but this way I can easily match lesson and file.
